/*
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes 
from some starting node to any node in the tree along the 
parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one 
node and does not need to go through the root.

For example:
Given the below binary tree,

       1
      / \
     2   3
Return 6.
